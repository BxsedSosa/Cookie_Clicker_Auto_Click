# Cookie_Clicker_Auto_Click
One of my first projects for an auto clicker

I watched a video from ClarityCoders on the basics of an auto-clicker. I used some of my own libraries and created my own functions to work for me since some of the copy and pasting of his code didn't work on my end. I used my own libraries since i found out that pyautogui can be a bit slow when it comes to clicking. Its a very basic program but it's just the start for me hope if anyone sees this can you please give me constructive criticism for future use and learning.

Thank you for checking this out!!
